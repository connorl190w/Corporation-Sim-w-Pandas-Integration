I created a simulation that acted like a corporation that sells different mobile phones, with various stores and customers with order numbers. With different classes like Phone, Store, and Customer, I was able to create IDs for all of the following. Using pandas, I analyzed what products were most prevalent amongst customers, stores that contained large-basket buyers, and other visualations to help see what products were really doing well within this Corporation. I also created a market basket, that helped analyze things such as the most frequently occurring set of items. Keep in mind that as this is a simulation, each time that the notebook runs will result in different outputs.
